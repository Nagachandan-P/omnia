Parameter,Details
"**iso_file_path**

``string``

Required","* Path where user has placed the OS iso image that needs to be provisioned on target nodes. Accepted file is RHEL-9.6-DVD (full OS).
* ``iso_file_path``  should contain the  ``provision_os``  and  ``provision_os_version``  values in the  filename."
"**node_name**

``string``

Required","* Prefix for target node names, if dynamically allocated.
* Hostname: ``<node_name>0000x.<domain_name>``
* Hostname should be less than or equal to 65 characters.
* **Example**: ``servernode00001.Omnia.test``,  where  ``<node_name>`` is ``servernode``,  ``<domain_name> is ``Omnia.test``, and ``00001`` is appended by Omnia.

**Default values**: ``node``"
"**pxe_mapping_file_path**

``string``

Optional","* This variable is required to discover nodes using a mapping file.
* The mapping file consists of the Service tag, Admin MAC, Hostname, Admin IP address, and/or BMC IP address.
* Ensure that the admin IP addresses provided are within the ``admin_static_ranges``.
* The headers of the ``.csv`` file are ``SERVICE_TAG``, ``ADMIN_MAC``, ``HOSTNAME``, ``ADMIN_IP``, and ``BMC_IP``
* A sample file is provided here: ``examples/pxe_mapping_file.csv``"
"**enable_switch_based**

``boolean`` [1]_

Required","* Variable indicates whether switch based discovery should be enabled to discover the nodes
* To enable switch based discovery, set ``enable_switch_based`` to true.
* If ``enable_switch_based`` is set to true,the following inputs should be provided:

     * ``switch_based_details`` should be provided in ``provision_config.yml``
     * ``switch_snmp3_username`` and ``switch_snmp3_password`` should be provided in ``provision_config_credentials.yml``
     * ``bmc_network`` details with ``nic_name``, ``netmask_bits``, ``static_range``, and ``dynamic_range`` should be provided in network_spec.yml

* Accepted values:


     * ``true``
     * ``false`` <- Default

.. caution:: If ``enable_switch_based`` is set to true, bmc discovery will be skipped. To enable bmc discovery, set ``enable_switch_based`` to ``false`` and provide ``bmc_network`` details in ``network_spec.yml``.

"
"**switch_based_details**

``JSON List``

Optional","* This variable is required when nodes are to be discovered via switch details (that is ``enable_switch_based`` is set to true).
* JSON list of switches to query for target nodes.
* Split port ranges are not accepted here. (Ex: 10:5-10:10 will not be valid).
* Example: ::

  - { ip: 172.96.28.12, ports: '1-48,49:3,50' }


* Example with 2 switches: ::

  - { ip: 172.96.28.12, ports: '1-48,49:3,50' }
  - { ip: 172.96.28.14, ports: '1,2,3,5' }

"
"**disk_partition**

``JSON list``

Optional","* User defined disk partition applied to remote servers.
* The disk partition ``desired_capacity`` has to be provided in MB.
* Valid ``mount_point`` values accepted for disk partition are /home, /var, /tmp, /usr, swap.
* Default partition size provided for RHEL is /boot: 1024MB, /boot/efi: 256MB and remaining space to / partition.
* Values are accepted in the form of JSON list such as: , - { mount_point: ""/home"", desired_capacity: ""102400"" }
 

**Default values**: ``- { mount_point: """", desired_capacity: """" }``"
"**timezone**

``string``

Required","Timezone to be used during OS provisioning. Available timezones are provided `here <../../../Appendices/Timezones.html>`_.

Choices:

* ``GMT`` <- default
* ``EST``
* ``CET``
* ``MST``
* ``CST6CDT``
* ``PST8PDT``"
"**language**

``string``

Required","Language to be used during OS provisioning.

**Default value**: ``en-US``"
"**default_lease_time**

``integer``

Required","Default lease time for IPs assigned by DHCP. Range: 21600-86400

**Default value**: ``86400``"
"**ntp_support**

``boolean``

Required","* The ``ntp_support`` variable denotes whether the cluster will have a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server configured on the OIM or not.
* If ``ntp_support`` is set to ``true``, an NTP server will be configured on the OIM and the time will be synchronized across the cluster nodes during provisioning.
* If ``ntp_support`` is set to ``false``, the NTP server will not be configured and time will not be synchronized across the cluster nodes.
* **Default value**: ``true``
.. caution:: In a restricted network or proxy environment, it is not recommended to set up an NTP server on the OIM due to potential failures in connecting to the public NTP pools."
