	This function reads the stanza file and extracts the bmc IP and serial number of the nodes.
	It iterates over each line in the file and checks if the line contains 'serial=' or 'bmc=',
	indicating the presence of the serial number or bmc IP.
	If the line contains 'serial=', it splits the line on '=' and appends the last element

	If the line contains 'bmc=', it splits the line on '=' and appends the last element
	(the bmc IP) to the 'bmc' list.
